        Are you a young person looking to learn more 
        about science? Come on down to our museum, 
        there's plenty to see and do. You can learn 
        about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, 
        or why not travel back in time and meet our 
        resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits are 
        designed to be accessible for interested minds, 
        so make sure you come ready to learn and explore.
        We also have the Young Stars club which meets once 
        a week on a Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where 
        you'll get to explore and experiment with our team 
        of experts. During the school holidays we run special 
        holiday clubs where you can join other children your 
        age to go on a journey of discovery. Each holiday we 
        pick a new theme to explore. To find out more about 
        the holiday club and how you can join, send us a message.

        On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, 
        the Energetica exhibition is coming to the Community 
        Science Museum. It's a series of installations that 
        allow visitors to experience the power of the elements 
        as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, 
        to 'Wind Island' that shows how turbines are able to use 
        and control wind to create power.
